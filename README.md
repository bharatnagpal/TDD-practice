## setup

1. clone this repository to your machine.
2. go into the project root directory and run the command `npm install`.
3. ru  the test suite using the command `npm test`.

if the command `npm test` doesnt work, you may need to install mocha globally on your machine. do this with command `npm install -g mocha`.

## what we learned working on this project

- I learned how to use chai's assertion syntax for unit tests.
